## Motivation

Reduce the time I spend on thinking what the readme is to have as a structure and instead spend time on what I'd prefer writing in it.

## Features

- Minimalistic CLI
- Basic set of things to be answered

## Install 
- Download the binary from the releases or build one yourself.
```
$ ln -sf /path/to/release/binary /usr/local/bin/genreadme
# make sure you have /usr/local/bin in your PATH
```

## Usage

```sh
$ genreadme
```

- **Make sure to replace license type, holder of the license and feature lines in the generated readme**

## Contribute

The easiest way to contribute is to fork this repository and create a pull request with whatever issue you have picked up. Though, do let the maintainer know if you are picking up an issue so there are no overlaps
